# UniFi Protect ARM64

Run UniFi Protect in Docker on ARM64 hardware.

## Usage

Run the container as a daemon:

```bash
docker run -d --name unifi-protect-arm64  \
    --privileged \
    --tmpfs /run \
    --tmpfs /run/lock \
    --tmpfs /tmp \
    -v /sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup:ro \
    -v /storage/srv:/srv \
    -v /storage/data:/data \
    --network host \
    markdegroot/unifi-protect-arm64:latest
```

Now you can access UniFi Protect at `https://localhost/`.

## Storage
UniFi Protect needs a lot of storage to record video. Protect will fail to start if there is not at least 100GB disk space available, so make sure to store your Docker volumes on a disk with some space (`/storage` in the above run command).

## Stuck at "Device Updating"
If you are stuck at a popup saying "Device Updating" with a blue loading bar after the initial setup, just run `systemctl restart unifi-core` inside the container or restart the entire container. This happens only the first time after the initial setup.

## Build your own container
To build your own container put the deb file for `unifi-core` (for unifi-protect 1.17.3 you need unifi-core 1.6.65) in the `put-unifi-core-deb-here` folder and run:
```bash
docker build -t markdegroot/unifi-protect-arm64 .
```
